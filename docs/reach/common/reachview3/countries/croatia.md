## Rover Setup

### Coordinate System

Choose a coordinate system based on the `HTRS96` datum (such as `HTRS96 / CroatiaÂ TM`).

### Vertical Datum

Choose the `HVRS71 height` vertical datum.

The `HRG2009` geoid is used to perform the transformation.

## Base Setup

Your base or NTRIP service should be in `HTRS96`.

!!! note ""
	The `HTRS96` datum is a national realization of `ETRS89`.

When setting up a base station on a benchmark, enter `HTRS96` geographic coordinates (lat/long) and ellipsoidal height in the ReachView 3 *Settings / Base mode*.
